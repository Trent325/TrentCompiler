Gonna stop for the night here. If mine is not graded tomorrow I will do if and maybe while.
Overall I think this project is my worst quality work and will be redoing it on my own over the summer just for fun.
I think I used every worst practice possible even though I knew it was worst practice. IDK why I did that but I did not 
in project 1, it just went down hill from there. Showed me that I need to work on implementing best practice all the time.
Kinda cool cause I normally do web dev or script, but I was a lower level for this. Had a great time, my grade does not reflect the hours and 
effort I put in, but thats fine life hard then you die. Thanks for creating a cool project.
